# This project is currently under development

## Getting started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is an AI interview application created using React, NextJs, TailwindCSS, Supabase, Vapi and other technologies.
The application should let a user login, select a job from the listings, upload the resume of the user, create an interview session with the 
user where an AI ingests the JD and resume to formulate a set of relevant questions and asks them to the user, when done, a detailed feedback is shared with the user.
Future plan is to replace Vapi with an instance of Ollama and an open source model.

## Setup

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
